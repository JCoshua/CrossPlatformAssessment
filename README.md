Controls
Move your mouse to control platforms
Press R to reset the game
Press Escape to exit the game

Goal
Your goal is to get to the bottom of the stage. You can't just fall off though, as you'll fail if you stay in the air for too long. 
You have to use platforms to manuver your way down. Some platforms can be moved while others can be rotated, and some, do nothing.

Bugs
The only real bug is that sometimes the player hits the ground quickly before becoming airborne again causes the timer to not reset.
